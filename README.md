# AI_Model_Resume_Screening_with_NLP_prototype
This project automates the evaluation of resumes by extracting relevant information and comparing it to job descriptions. The prototype uses techniques like text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and cosine similarity to rank resumes based on their relevance to the job requirements, helping streamline the recruitment process.

# Resume Screening with NLP prototype

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a deep learning model for educational and experimental purposes. It is part of coursework for the **AI Lab** and demonstrates core deep learning concepts such as model architecture, training, evaluation, and optimization techniques.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model building using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch)
- Training and validation
- Evaluation metrics
- Visualization of results

## 📁 Files

- `AI_LAB_Model (3).ipynb`: Main notebook containing all code and explanations.
